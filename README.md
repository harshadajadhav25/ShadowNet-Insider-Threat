# 🛡️ ShadowNet — Insider Threat Detection Simulator

ShadowNet is a **Data Engineering + Cybersecurity portfolio project**.  
It simulates real-world insider threats and models how logs move through an AWS pipeline, how anomalies are detected, and how threat activity is visualized through dashboards.

This project includes:
- Synthetic security log generation  
- An AWS ETL pipeline (S3 → Glue → Athena)  
- Anomaly detection logic (ML + rule-based)  
- A Dash dashboard for visualizing suspicious behavior  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

ShadowNet will simulate and analyze multiple insider threat behaviors, including:

- **Privilege escalation**  
- **After-hours login anomalies**  
- **Lateral movement across systems**  
- **Misuse of S3/EC2 administrative privileges**

The project covers:
- Designing the log schema  
- Creating synthetic log events  
- Building AWS data pipelines  
- Developing anomaly detection logic  
- Designing visual dashboards  
- Writing a portfolio-grade technical report

## 📅 Phase 1 (Week 1): Planning

During Phase 1, we will:

1. **Define four insider threat scenarios**  
2. **Design the complete data schema** (log fields + event types)  
3. **Create a high-level architecture diagram**  
4. **Set up the project folder structure**  
5. **Prepare the repository for Phase 2 development**

All work for Phase 1 is located in the `docs/` folder.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Begin **Phase 2: Synthetic Log Generation**  
- Implement Python-based simulated users, events, and anomalies  
- Begin scheduling logic for daily log generation
